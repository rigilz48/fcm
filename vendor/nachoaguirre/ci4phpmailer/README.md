```
This command will write into composer.json beyond download and place this project files and PHPMailer dependencies into your ``vendor`` folder.

Your able to send e-mail anywhere inside your CodeIgniter application.


Load the library in your controller
```PHP

```

Then in your method, create an instance of `Mail()` class:
```PHP
 $email = new \Nachoaguirre\Ci4phpmailer\Libraries\Email
```

## Example

Use the class in the same way you use the CI4 Email Class


```PHP
$email = new \Nachoaguirre\Ci4phpmailer\Libraries\Email;		
$config['protocol']   = 'smtp';
$config['SMTPHost']   = 'smtp.gmail.com';
$config['SMTPUser']   = 'your@gmail.com';
$config['SMTPPass']   = 'yourp4ssword';
$config['SMTPPort']   = 465;
$config['SMTPCrypto'] = 'ssl';
$email->initialize($config);

$email->setFrom('noreply@yoursite.com', 'Your Name');
$email->setTo('buddy@foo.com');

$email->setSubject('Hey dude!');
$email->setMessage('Corre que te pillo...');

$email->send(); 
```
That's all.
